My day was ok.
This morning I had a mock exam which I will probably get a below average mark for, but it would be no less than what I deserve as I only revised the night before.
Tomorrow I have another mock exam which I have done basically no revision for, and I should've done some tonight really.
That exam is in the afternoon so I will do some revision in the morning, and hopefully get lucky with what is in the paper.
Right now i'm just on Reddit and listening to music. Well done on your essay, you got a great mark! What subject is it?
