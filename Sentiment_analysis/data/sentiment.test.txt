0	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
2	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
1	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
0	The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
1	The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
0	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
1	It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
0	A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
1	None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
0	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
2	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
1	Fails to bring as much to the table .
1	A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .
0	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
1	If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
1	I hate this movie
3	An imaginative comedy\/thriller .
4	( A ) rare , beautiful film .
4	( An ) hilarious romantic comedy .
3	Never ( sinks ) into exploitation .
0	( U ) nrelentingly stupid .
