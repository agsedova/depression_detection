# Depression Detection project

Here is the source code for the Depression Detection Project (Course "Affective Computing", WiSe 19/20)

The main files for analysing the text input 

### [Data](https://github.com/agsedova/depression_detection/tree/master/data), [static](https://github.com/agsedova/depression_detection/tree/master/static), [images](https://github.com/agsedova/depression_detection/tree/master/images)

Manually collected different data which we use for testing our app (for more detailed information please look at the paper)

### [Templates](https://github.com/agsedova/depression_detection/tree/master/templates)
Files for the front-end. 

### [Sentiment_analysis](https://github.com/agsedova/depression_detection/tree/master/Sentiment_analysis)
Here are all the files which are needed to perform the sentiment analysis with LSTM.

**data** : here are the data which we used as training, development and tests set as well as data which we used for demonstrating our app during the final presentation (answers.txt)

**sent_train.py** : training our LSTM Model

**sent_predict.py** : sentiment prediction on the new data

We have already trained the model for sentiment analysis with LSTM. If you want to use it, please download it [here](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/07l-mKo0NRemSlP5AQQY__HgQ#trained_model) and put the file in Sentiment_analysis folder
