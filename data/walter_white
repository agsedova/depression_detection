I am not turning down the money!
I am turning down you!
You get it?!
I want nothing to do with you!
Ever since I met you, everything I ever cared about is gone!
Ruined, turned to shit, dead, ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg!
I have never been more alone!
I HAVE NOTHING! NO ONE! ALRIGHT, IT'S ALL GONE, GET IT?
No, no, no, why...why would you get it?
What do you even care, as long as you get what you want, right?
You don't give a shit about me!
You said I was no good.
I'm nothing! Why would you want me, huh?
You said my meth is inferior, right?
Right? Hey! You said my cook was GARBAGE!
Hey, screw you, man! Screw you!
“I have spent my whole life scared, frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen, 50 years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at three in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis, I sleep just fine.
What I came to realize is that fear, that’s the worst of it.
That’s the real enemy.
So, get up, get out in the real world and you kick that bastard as hard you can right in the teeth.”
My name is Walter Hartwell White.
I live at 308 Negra Aroya Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt.
I am speaking to my family now. Skyler, you are the love of my life.
I hope you know that. Walter Jr., you’re my big man.
There are going to be some things that you’ll come to learn about me in the next few days.
But just know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. Goodbye.
